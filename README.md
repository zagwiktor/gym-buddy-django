# GymBuddy


GymBuddy was developed using technologies such as Django, Rest API, and React.js. The main goal of the project was to create a tool that allows users to track and adjust their training progress in one place. Users can add exercises to build their training plan, then submit daily reports based on which they generate charts to visualize their progress or any regressions.
